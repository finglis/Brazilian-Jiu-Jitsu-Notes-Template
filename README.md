# Brazilian-Jiu-Jitsu-Notes-Template

Template for mapping out BJJ positions, transitions and submissions.

## Requirements

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - Note taking app that allows for connections between those notes to be viewed as graphs.
- Tylenol and tolerance...

## How To Use

- Run obsidian and select "Open folder as vault" then select the folder where you cloned this repository (or downloaded and saved these files on your computer).
- Once opened in Obsidian, check out the "How To Use" note for instructions on how to use and the logic behind the set-up.

## Note

This was created to help myself retain BJJ techniques better. Feel free to use and modify it as you see fit and send over pull requests.

The useful plugin to actually map out paths is in development but will be linked here once available.
